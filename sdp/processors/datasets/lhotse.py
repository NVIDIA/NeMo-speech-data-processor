class LhotseImport(BaseProcessor):
    """Processor to create an initial manifest imported from a Lhotse CutSet.
    The ``input_manifest_file`` is expected to point to a Lhotse CutSet manifest,
    which usually has ``cuts`` in its name and a ``.jsonl`` or ``.jsonl.gz`` extension.

    Lhotse is a library for speech data processing and loading; see:

    * https://github.com/lhotse-speech/lhotse
    * https://lhotse.readthedocs.io

    It can be installed using ``pip install lhotse``.

    .. caution:: Currently we only support the importing of cut sets that represent
        single-channel, single-audio-file-per-utterance datasets.

    Returns:
        This processor generates an initial manifest file with the following fields::

            {
                "audio_filepath": <path to the audio file>,
                "duration": <duration of the audio in seconds>,
                "text": <transcription (with capitalization and punctuation)>,
