class CreateInitialManifestYodas2(ListToEntries):
    """
    Custom processor for generating an initial manifest from a dataset entry where
    one of the fields contains a list of segment dictionaries.

    In addition to flattening entries via ListToEntries, it also:
    - Extracts `yodas_id` from each entry's audio file name.
    - Enriches each entry with a precomputed `duration` from an external duration file.

    The final output will contain entries with the following required fields:
        - source_audio_filepath
        - yodas_id
        - duration

    Args:
        **kwargs: Passed through to ListToEntries, including:
            - field_with_list (str): Name of the field to flatten.
            - output_field (str): Required if inner list items are primitives.
            - fields_to_save (list[str]): Fields to preserve from the original entry.
