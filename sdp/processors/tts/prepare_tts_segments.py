    """This processor merges adjacent segments from the same speaker and splits segments to have a complete utterance.

    It processes segments by merging those from the same speaker that are adjacent, then
    splits segments based on duration limits, punctuation marks, and audio quality metrics
    like bandwidth.

    Args:
        min_duration (float): Minimum duration in seconds for a segment. Defaults to 5
        max_duration (float): Maximum duration in seconds for a segment. Defaults to 20
        max_pause (float): Maximum pause duration in seconds between merged segments. Defaults to 2
        terminal_punct_marks (str): String containing punctuation marks to split on. Defaults to ".!?。？？！。"
        punctuation_split_only (bool): Whether to only split on punctuation. Defaults to False

    Returns:
        The same data as in the input manifest, but with segments merged and split according
        to the specified parameters.
