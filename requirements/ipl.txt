nemo_run

# Nemo repository path is also required, it is used to locate scripts and configs from NeMo.
#
# To set this up:
#   1. Clone the NeMo repository:
#        git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo.git /your/desired/path/to/nemo
#   2. Set the path in nemo_run_config.yaml:
#        nemo_directory: /your/desired/path/to/nemo
#
# Make sure this path is valid and NeMo is up to date if you're using its scripts.
